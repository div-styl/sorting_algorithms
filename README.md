# Big O notion to measure

an overview of how we use Big O notation to measure the time complexity of sorting algorithms. By understanding the time complexity of different algorithms, we can choose the most efficient algorithm for the size and type of data that we need to sort. This can lead to significant improvements in program performance.

## Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is a type of sorting algorithm you can use to arrange a set of values in ascending order. If you want, you can also implement bubble sort to sort the values in descending order.

## Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time by comparisons. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
